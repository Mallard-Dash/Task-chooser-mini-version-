# Task-chooser-mini-version-
An ultra-mini task-chooser i've made in C#. The main purpose is to practice C# programming but also to choose a random task from the list.

1. I've pre-written the tasks in the list which I find as useful subjects to learn more from.
2. You start the program and press either R = Remove task, G = Generate random task or A = Add new task.
3. When 'G' is pressed the random-module chooses an item from the list and presents this to the user.
4. In my case, I study the choosen subject for 1 hour, then take 10 minute break.
5. Repeat as many times you like.
